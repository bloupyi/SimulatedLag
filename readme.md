# SimulatedLag

## About SimulatedLag

**SimulatedLag** allows you to artificially increase a player's latency by delaying incoming and outgoing packets. This can be useful for testing lag compensation, balancing mechanics, or simulating network issues for debugging purposes.

⚠ **Note:** This plugin may conflict with other plugins that use packets, such as **ProtocolLib** or similar packet-based tools.

## Features
- Introduces a **minimum ping threshold** for players.
- Delays both **incoming and outgoing packets** dynamically.
- Provides a **command-based interface** to control player lag.
- Includes an **API** for developers to integrate simulated lag into their own plugins.

## Commands
| Command                         | Description                                            | Permission           |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `/simulatedlag <player> <ping>` | Sets the targeted lag (ping threshold) for the player. | `simulatedlag.admin` |

## API Usage
Developers can interact with **SimulatedLag** through its API:

```java
SimulatedLag plugin = ... // Get the instance of SimulatedLag
plugin.setPlayerTargetedLag(player, 200); // Set 200ms lag
```

### API Methods
